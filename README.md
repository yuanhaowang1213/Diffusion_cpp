# Diffusion_cpp

This folder contains the cpp code for diffusion models.

Installation could see [install guide](./install.sh)

Currently, this model only supports a limited set of architectures. Parallel computing code can be shared upon request.

Transformer-architecture is not included currently. I tried on my python approach, but it was a bit difficult to train on the resources i could got access (time-consuming). I did not include the cpp version. But i will update the model to include the support for transformer.
